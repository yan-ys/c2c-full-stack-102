# Lesson 09

This lesson folder currently contains the **end-state (completed) app for Lesson 08**.

## End State Location

- `/workspaces/c2c-full-stack-102/lesson-09/starter/app`

## Before You Start: Sync Your Fork

Because you are working from a fork, make sure your fork (and your Codespace) are up to date.

1. In the GitHub website, open **your fork** of this repo.
2. Click **Sync fork** (or **Fetch upstream**) and complete the prompts.
3. In your Codespace terminal (inside VS Code), pull the latest changes:

```bash
git pull
```

## Step 0: Create Your Working App Folder

Before you run or edit anything, create the working folder for this lesson by copying an `app/` directory into `lesson-09/app`.

Option A: copy **your completed app from the prior lesson**:

```bash
cp -r /workspaces/c2c-full-stack-102/lesson-08/app /workspaces/c2c-full-stack-102/lesson-09/app
```

Option B: if you don’t have a working prior lesson app yet, copy the provided starter (Lesson 08 end-state):

```bash
cp -r /workspaces/c2c-full-stack-102/lesson-09/starter/app /workspaces/c2c-full-stack-102/lesson-09/app
```

After this step, you should have:

- `/workspaces/c2c-full-stack-102/lesson-09/app/client`
- `/workspaces/c2c-full-stack-102/lesson-09/app/server`

## How to Run (Codespaces-friendly)

Run server and client in 2 terminals:

Server:

```bash
cd /workspaces/c2c-full-stack-102/lesson-09/app/server
npm install
npm run devStart
```

Client:

```bash
cd /workspaces/c2c-full-stack-102/lesson-09/app/client
npm install
npm start
```
